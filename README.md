# WELCOME TO THE FORUM OF PAIN
## How to use
- Download Node.js
- In console in vscode, type npm install then npm start, it SHOULD work
- Afterwards it will direct you to a site, it should work as intended with checkmarks, delete, add and edit features and so on
- Have fun I suppose if all works well

# WHAT I LEARNT
## Key learnings
- Mind EVERY imperfection, be it small typos, misinputs and missing code
- ALWAYS go back and check for wrongs, a small error could turn big in seconds
- Always have your laptop charged during coding sessions, mine died midway through (I was very angry)

## Technical challenges
- Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't even WITH the correct code
- It lagged, ALOT
- Errors tend to happen without being found, giving a blank screen without a clue.
